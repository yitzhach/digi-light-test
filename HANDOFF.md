# DigiLight — Handoff

Start a new chat with: "Read HANDOFF.md and continue." Keep this file short.
**Rule:** update this file in the same commit (or right after) every push to `main`.

## Status
- Last updated: 2026-10-11
- Last code change on `main`: merge of `claude/epic-wright-h77sdu` (2026-10-11) — view zoom
  to 400%, graze relief/Shadow length/Softness/presets fixes, graze lab
- Before that: `b7997a6` (2026-10-10), via `c074e30` — layer masks, Graze light effect
- Deploy: automatic via Cloudflare Workers Builds on push to `main` (`wrangler.jsonc`); manual Pages upload no longer needed
- Live: digi-light-test.bobdylan2000.workers.dev (Workers static assets)

## What it is
Static, no-build, in-browser painting relighter (WebGL2, ES modules). Upload a photo
of a painting → estimate surface relief → relight with movable virtual lights → export.

## Map (src/)
- `app.js` — main bench: load image, build G-buffer, re-shade on interaction (largest file)
- `studio.js` + `presets.js` — Creative Studio UI, surface/material/lighting presets, undo History
- `gbuffer.js` — single-photo surface estimation (directional + even-light estimates,
  normalised, blended); `shade.js` — per-frame shading pass (area-light penumbra)
- `export.js` — full-res tiled export; `gl.js` — WebGL2 scaffolding; `kelvin.js` — colour temp
- `photometric.js`, `register.js`, `sphere.js` — multi-photo capture path (demo section)
- `synth.js` — synthetic painting with known relief (tests); `measure.js` — image stats
- `tests/browser.cjs` — Playwright regression (see README "Validation")

## Run / test
- `python3 -m http.server 8766` then open http://localhost:8766
- `node tests/browser.cjs` (needs Playwright; Chromium at /opt/pw-browsers in cloud sessions)

## Real-painting test (next session starts here)
Graze tuning so far is measured only on synthetic paintings (`tools/graze-lab.cjs`).
To judge it on a real painting, by eye:
1. Photo: a painted surface with visible impasto, sharp, straight-on, ~2000 px+ wide.
   Ideally two shots: the normal photo, and one with a torch/lamp raking from the left
   (the direction the graze defaults to). Note the painting's width (cm) and a guess
   at impasto depth (mm).
2. Load the normal photo. Set Painting width, Texture depth and Photo was lit (Even
   for a normal photo) under Quick setup; leave Fine-tune alone.
3. Open **Graze light · raking texture**, click Visible, and step through the presets
   (Gentle raking, Classic raking, Long shadows, Soft strip light, Every detail (raw)).
   Keep Opacity at each preset's value. Use B / Split to compare against the original.
4. Zoom to 200–400% on a stretch with clear ridges. Check for: blocky or "chunky"
   relief, glitter/shimmer, shadows where the paint is flat, and missing shadows at
   ridges you can see.
5. Compare with the raking photo: set the graze direction to match the lamp (0° right,
   90° top, 180° left) and Angle to wall 1–3°. Shadow positions should match where the
   lamp's shadows fall.
6. Record: preset, Angle to wall, Opacity, direction, Texture depth, and a zoomed
   Split screenshot of one region. Note what looks wrong and where.

## Done recently
- 10-11: merged `claude/epic-wright-h77sdu` into `main` (zoom to 400%, graze fixes below
  now live). The earlier 10-11 push only carried layer masks and graze light.
- 10-11 (merged from `claude/epic-wright-h77sdu`):
  - View zoom 20–400%: stage scrolls past 100%; Ctrl/Cmd+wheel/pinch zooms about the
    pointer; Space/middle-drag pans. Sharp zoom re-renders the visible region from the
    full-res photo after 250 ms idle via `renderTiles` (export.js, shared with Export);
    `renderState(outW)` gives a rescaled state COPY (never mutate live state).
  - Graze artifacts fixed (user: "chunky", "artificial texture" at 1–3°): graze uses
    its own smoothed relief (`GBuffer.buildGraze`, Detail in painting widths), fine
    relief only in shading (Fine texture × tan(e)/tan 10°), own shadow reach
    (`grazeReach`), Clean shadows (blocker bias), Softness (source size). Presets in
    `grazePresets` (presets.js); default = Classic raking. Old saves validate to
    neutral values (look unchanged).
  - `tools/graze-lab.cjs` + `GBuffer.afterHeight` seam: scores the graze vs true
    relief on synthetic paintings. Tried and dropped (negative): azimuth-spread strip
    light, coherence-adaptive smoothing. Tests take `DIGILIGHT_PORT`.
- 10-10 (merged `c074e30`): Graze light section replaces the per-light
  "Graze from L/R/T/B" buttons. `state.graze` `{enabled, angle, elevation, opacity}`
  (angle = where light comes from, 0° right, 90° top) drives one extra hard light in
  `shade.js`, rendered separately and cross-faded over the relit result
  (`uGrazeOpacity`), before layers. Dial in studio.js `renderGraze`; hidden in
  diagnostic views and during Sweep. In history, projects, presets (validated).
- 10-10 (merged `c074e30`): layer masks. Each layer
  has Paint hide / Paint show / Hide all / Reset; strokes live in `layer.mask`
  `{base, strokes}` (like relief `strokes`), rasterised in studio.js into
  `state.layerMaskData` (768², one RGBA channel per layer slot) and sampled in
  `shade.js` (`uLayerMask`, `uLayerSel`); red overlay (`maskOverlay`) only while
  painting, never in exports. Presets drop masks; new photo clears them. Fixed: a
  deferred checkpoint landing mid-stroke split one stroke into two undo steps.
- 10-09 (merged `2e83379`): "Light dots: on/off" toggle (was
  "Light guides") is the only thing hiding dots besides Sweep; grabbing a dot leaves
  Before/Split and brush mode; off-painting lights pin to the edge. Open your painting
  no longer resets edits; a new photo is undoable (history kept).
- 10-09 (`2e83379`): view zoom (− / 100% / + / Show all lights, keys - = 0); dots beyond
  the view pin to its edge, dashed. Graze from left/right/top/bottom + "Grazing side
  light" preset: 3° off the wall, 1 painting width out, power compensated
  (`grazePower`), shadows full-strength and crisp. Lights may sit -1.5..2.5, z down
  to 0.01, angle to 1°, Brightness slider is logarithmic up to 1024. Shadow march
  takes up to 96 steps on long (grazing) shadows; reach cap 0.3 widths.
- 10-09 (`2e83379`): Layers · blend effects — up to 4 layers (Original or Relit
  source, 13 blend modes, opacity, visible, order, duplicate). Composited at the end
  of `shade.js` in sRGB, so exports include them; `state.layers` is in history,
  projects and presets (validated in studio.js `validate`).
- 10-09 (PR #1): texture depth (mm) + painting width drive one height field for shading
  and shadows; even-light relief estimate for evenly lit photos (`photoDiffuse`);
  per-light source size, angular penumbra, physical shadow reach; Quick setup,
  photo-lit compass, light types/Diffusion/Angle/Mirror, Sweep light, Shadows view;
  advanced sliders folded into Fine-tune. Legacy projects load with `physical: 0`.
- 10-09: storage ops queue instead of being dropped (fixed preset-import test failure)
- 09-18: reusable named presets (save/apply/auto/download/import)
- 09-17: Creative Studio — presets, before/after + split, undo/redo, brushes, saved projects (IndexedDB)

## Next up (candidates — confirm with user)
1. Check calibrated relief on real photos of impasto (synthetic-only so far; the
   cloud environment's network policy blocked Wikimedia). See "Real-painting test" above.
2. Optional "match original brightness" exposure after a lighting preset
3. Project save for the multi-photo capture workflow (currently single-photo only)
4. Large-export memory limits / preview vs export differences at very high res
5. User feedback on the graze presets on real photos (lab is synthetic only); the
   1–1.5° presets still lose some real ridge shadow and read bright — a better
   ridge-vs-grain discriminator would help.
6. Feedback on layers/masks (maybe a "current result" source, mask brush hardness,
   showing the mask alone)

## Gotchas
- Calibrated mode (`state.physical`, single photo only) derives heightScale,
  reliefStrength and shadow reach in `app.js` updateDerived; export tiles reuse the
  preview's measured `heightStats`, never re-measure.
- No backticks inside GLSL comments: the shaders are JS template strings.
- Must serve over HTTP (ES modules); don't open index.html directly.
- Deploy index.html, studio.css, src/, _headers together.
